    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An even simpler recipe. Greek yogurt with sliced banana, topped with cinnamon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Greek Yogurt (I've tried both plain and vanilla and enjoyed both)</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Powdered Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put greek yogurt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Slice banana into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Top with cinnamon powder. Go light at first - 
            it's easy to add more, 
            but difficult to take it out once it's there!
        </li>
    </ol>
